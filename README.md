# name-generator
This project provides a random project name generator based off of a python script reading a word dictionary

###Syntax to run the script is: 
    python name-generator.py
The script will randomly generate 3 project names that you might want to use. I created the word list myself using a combination of military 
operations and tech words...some of the names can get funny!

Example: 

    user@bash$ python name-generator.py
    First Choice: Flame BROADWAY
    Second Choice: White paper NEWMARKET
    Third Choice: CHESTNUT VIKING
